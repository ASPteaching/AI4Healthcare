# AI : Everyone talks about it

- AI is a broad term that refers to _any technology that enables a machine to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence_, such as __learning__, __problem-solving__, and __decision-making__. 

- AI is present in many different technologies and applications that we use every day, such as smartphones, social media, and personal assistants like Siri and Alexa. 
- As a result, AI has become *an integral part of our daily lives*, and it is increasingly being used in a wide range of industries and applications. 

<!-- - This is why we can argue that AI is "everywhere" – it is present in many different aspects of our daily lives, and it is continuing to grow and expand. -->
---
# Examples of AI in everyday life

- __Smartphone personal assistants__, Siri and Google Assistant.
- __Social media algorithms__,  to recommend content and customize user experiences.
- __Virtual assistants__, Amazon's Alexa and Apple's HomePod.
- __Autonomous vehicles__, such as self-driving cars, which use AI to navigate roads and make driving decisions.
- __Fraud detection systems__, which use AI to analyze transactions and identify potential fraudulent activity.
- __Customer service chatbots__, which use natural language processing to provide answers to customer inquiries.
- __Healthcare systems__, which use AI to analyze medical images and assist with diagnosis and treatment planning.
- And many other such as: __Online education platforms__, __Video game AI__ or __Recommender Systems__.

.right-column[
- A common concern is _Will AI replace humans?_
- AI advocates don't think so, instead they talk of _complement_, _enhance_, support... 
- This concern also exists in medicine
  - Some AI experts claim that in 3-5 years radiologist will not be necessary anymore.
- Dr. Eric Topol in his book Deep Medicine:
  - Introducing AI in Healthcare is good
  - It lets the machine do the machine work
      - Fill forms, Scan images
    - With more efficiency and new workflows.
  - And the doctor has more time for patients.

- AI powered monitoring gadgets, such as bracelets, smart watches and many other   have become common.
- Some, such as the Apple Watch allow for continuous heart-rate monitoring and are inteded to detect potential CV incidents.
- Many potential benefits: 
  - Motivation for exercise
  - Real time data for detection / prevention
- But not free from problems
  - Lack of standarization and credibility
  - Potential data protection issues when sahring data

.right-column[
- AI, particularly through image analysis with deep learning, is being used to detect diseases, such as cancer, more accurately in early stages.
- Automatic detection can be faster and highly accurate, but _beware of biases and overfitting_ 
- It can reduce false positives and unnecessary expensive/dangerous tests s.a. biopsies.
- Not free from problems
  - Gender or race biases exist
  - Somee tumours that would never progress arre included causing unnecessary alert

.right-column[
- Machine learning algorithms are being used in many fileds for classification (diagnosis) and prediction (prognosis).
- Some may work like black-boxes (less intuitive than some statistical models), 
- Under the appropriate circumstances, enough data, and _correctly used_ may be very accurate.
- Typical scenario is analysis of medical imaging data or real time monitoring signals.

- AI empowered systems may be used to analyze EHR, Images and reports from a patient’s history to help select the correct, individually
customized treatment path.  
- Data availability, combined with AI tools allows shifting from:
  - _Treatments for populations_ where medical decisions are taken based on a few similar physical characteristics among patients, to
  - _Preventive, Personalized, Precision_ medicine to provide the specific treatment for a specific patient]
